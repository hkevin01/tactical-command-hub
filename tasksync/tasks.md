# Task
**PROMPT: Create Project Progress Tracker and Plan Comparison Document** 

  

Please analyze all the project plan files (plan.md, plan_part1.md, plan_part2.md, etc.) and create a comprehensive progress tracking document that includes: 

  

## Part 1: Plan Analysis & Consolidation 

- Extract all tasks, milestones, and deliverables from each plan file 

- Organize them by phase, category, or timeline 

- Identify any overlapping or duplicate items across plans 

- Create a master task list with unique identifiers 

  

## Part 2: Progress Status Template 

Create a status tracking document with: 

- **Completion Status**: ✅ Complete, 🟡 In Progress, ⭕ Not Started, ❌ Blocked, 🔄 Needs Review 

- **Priority Levels**: 🔴 Critical, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low 

- **Estimated vs Actual**: Time estimates vs actual time spent 

- **Dependencies**: What items depend on others 

- **Assignee/Owner**: Who is responsible for each item 

  

## Part 3: Comparison Matrix 

Generate a comparison table showing: 

- **Planned Item**: Original task from plan files 

- **Current Status**: Progress indicator 

- **Planned Date**: Original timeline from plans 

- **Actual Date**: When actually completed (if done) 

- **Variance**: Difference between planned and actual 

- **Notes**: Challenges, changes, or comments 

  

## Part 4: Progress Dashboard 

Create visual progress indicators: 

- Overall project completion percentage 

- Completion by phase/category 

- Items ahead of schedule vs behind schedule 

- Blocked items requiring attention 

- Upcoming deadlines in next 2 weeks 

  

## Part 5: Gap Analysis 

Identify: 

- Items completed that weren't in original plans (scope additions) 

- Planned items that were cancelled or deprioritized 

- Missing dependencies or prerequisites 

- Resource allocation differences from plan 

  

## Part 6: Recommendations 

Provide actionable insights: 

- Priority items to focus on next 

- Blocked items needing resolution 

- Plan adjustments based on actual progress 

- Resource reallocation suggestions 

  

## Format Requirements: 

- Use markdown format with clear headers 

- Include checkboxes for trackable items 

- Use tables for comparison data 

- Include date stamps for when status was last updated 

- Make it easy to update regularly (weekly/bi-weekly) 

  

## Example Format for Each Item: 

```markdown 

### [Phase] - [Task Name]  

- **ID**: TCH-001 

- **Status**: 🟡 In Progress (60% complete) 

- **Priority**: 🟠 High 

- **Planned**: Week 3-4 (July 15-28, 2025) 

- **Actual**: Started July 20, estimated completion August 2 

- **Variance**: +5 days delay 

- **Blockers**: Waiting for security review approval 

- **Owner**: Development Team 

- **Dependencies**: TCH-002 (User authentication setup) 

- **Notes**: Complexity higher than expected due to integration requirements
