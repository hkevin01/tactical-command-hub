Task detected: "examine plan_part2.md anything missing or not found create anything not 100% complete try to complete"

Analyzing plan_part2.md to identify remaining incomplete components and areas requiring implementation to achieve 100% completion status. Current overall project status is 85% complete according to the latest updates.

**IDENTIFIED INCOMPLETE COMPONENTS FROM PLAN_PART2.MD:**

Missing items requiring implementation:
1. ⭕ .copilot/prompts/ - Missing custom prompts directory
2. ⭕ src/main/resources/static/ - Missing web assets directory
3. ⭕ docs/project-plan.md - Referenced but missing file
4. ⭕ CHANGELOG.md - Missing changelog file
5. ⭕ data/sample/, data/schemas/, data/fixtures/ - Missing data content
6. ⭕ assets/images/, assets/icons/, assets/templates/ - Missing asset content

**TECHNICAL GAPS REQUIRING COMPLETION:**
1. **Phase 3 Security** (50% complete):
   - HTTPS/TLS configuration missing
   - Comprehensive audit logging system
   - OWASP security measures and dependency scanning
   - Security headers and input validation

2. **Phase 4 Service Layer** (80% complete):
   - Real-time communication system (WebSockets/messaging)
   - Reporting and analytics services
   - External system integration adapters

3. **Phase 5 API Layer** (API endpoints complete, infrastructure gaps):
   - API rate limiting and throttling
   - Performance monitoring and metrics
   - Comprehensive API testing suite

4. **Phase 6 Frontend** (0% complete):
   - Tactical operations dashboard
   - Interactive mapping and geospatial visualization
   - Mission planning interfaces
   - Reporting visualization components
   - Role-based UI customization

5. **Phase 7 Testing** (Partial complete):
   - Unit testing with coverage measurement
   - End-to-end testing framework
   - Performance and load testing
   - Security testing framework

6. **Phase 8 Deployment** (Minimal complete):
   - Production deployment pipeline
   - Monitoring and logging systems
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Security hardening
   - Operational procedures

Beginning systematic implementation of missing components to achieve 100% completion. Priority will be given to core missing files, security enhancements, and foundational infrastructure components.
