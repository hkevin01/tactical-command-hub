Task Analysis:
- Read plan.md completely
- Read plan_part2.md completely  
- Read plan_part3.md completely
- Extract all list items and requirements
- Create new markdown file with checkbox verification system
- Ensure complete coverage of all plan components

Beginning comprehensive plan document analysis and verification checklist creation. Progress will be tracked with detailed logging and completion percentages.
