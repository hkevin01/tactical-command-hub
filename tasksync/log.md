Task detected: "examine plan_part2.md anything missing or not found create anything not 100% complete try to complete"

Analyzing plan_part2.md to identify remaining incomplete components and areas requiring implementation to achieve 100% completion status. Current overall project status is 85% complete according to the latest updates.

**IDENTIFIED INCOMPLETE COMPONENTS FROM PLAN_PART2.MD:**

Missing items requiring implementation:
1. ⭕ .copilot/prompts/ - Missing custom prompts directory
2. ⭕ src/main/resources/static/ - Missing web assets directory
3. ⭕ docs/project-plan.md - Referenced but missing file
4. ⭕ CHANGELOG.md - Missing changelog file
5. ⭕ data/sample/, data/schemas/, data/fixtures/ - Missing data content
6. ⭕ assets/images/, assets/icons/, assets/templates/ - Missing asset content
