## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Tactical Command Hub team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Email the security team
Send details to: [security@tacticalcommand-hub.com](mailto:security@tacticalcommand-hub.com)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline varies based on complexity
- **Security Update Release**: As soon as possible after fix verification

### 4. Disclosure Process
1. We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will prepare a security advisory
4. We will release the security update
5. We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (with your permission)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your installation updated to the latest version
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review access logs
- Follow principle of least privilege for user accounts

### For Developers
- Review security guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security scans regularly

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password hashing
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Secure configuration defaults

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker container security
- Database connection security
- TLS/HTTPS enforcement (in production)
- Environment variable protection

## Known Security Considerations

### Development Environment
- Default configurations are not production-ready
- Development mode may expose debug information
- Test data should not contain real sensitive information

### Production Deployment
- Ensure HTTPS/TLS is properly configured
- Use production-grade secrets management
- Enable security monitoring and logging
- Regular security assessments recommended

## Security Testing

We employ various security testing methods:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning
- Regular security code reviews

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities:
- Maven dependency scanning
- Automated security updates for non-breaking changes
- Regular manual review of dependency security advisories

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:
1. Immediate assessment and containment
2. Impact analysis and user notification
3. Fix development and deployment
4. Post-incident review and documentation
5. Process improvement implementation

## Security Contact
