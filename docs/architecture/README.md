## Architecture Principles

### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer separation and responsibility boundaries
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with business logic encapsulation
- **SOLID Principles**: Object-oriented design best practices
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations in all architectural decisions

### Quality Attributes
- **Maintainability**: Clean code, proper documentation, testable design
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities and performance optimization
- **Security**: Defense in depth, secure by default configurations
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, graceful degradation, monitoring

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.x, Java 17
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT authentication
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers
- **Build**: Maven with comprehensive plugin ecosystem

## Documentation Standards

### Diagrams
- Use standard UML notation where applicable
- Include legends and annotations
- Keep diagrams up-to-date with implementation
- Use consistent styling and colors

### Architecture Decision Records
- Document significant architectural decisions
- Include context, options considered, and rationale
- Update when decisions change or evolve
- Link to related implementation details

## Review Process
- Architecture changes require review and approval
- Updates must maintain consistency across documents
- Impact analysis for breaking changes
- Regular architecture review sessions
