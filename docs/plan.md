Project Overview
Create a Java-based Command and Control System Simulator that mimics the functionality of military joint operations platforms like GCCS-J. This project will demonstrate enterprise-level software development practices used in defense contracting environments.

Project Name: tactical-command-hub
Core Objectives
Build a scalable, secure command and control system that can:

Manage tactical unit positioning and status
Process real-time mission data feeds
Coordinate multi-domain operations (land, air, sea, cyber)
Generate operational reports and analytics
Maintain audit trails for all system actions

Sample User Stories
Epic: Unit Command and Control

As a Command Officer, I want to view real-time unit positions so I can make informed tactical decisions
As an Operations Planner, I want to create mission plans with waypoints and objectives
As a Intelligence Analyst, I want to input threat assessments that automatically update unit risk levels
Epic: Mission Execution

As a Field Commander, I want to receive mission updates and status changes in real-time
As a Logistics Officer, I want to track resource consumption and request resupply
As a Communications Specialist, I want to maintain secure channels between all operational units
Deployment Strategy
Local Development: Docker Compose with all services
Testing Environment: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
Production Simulation: Kubernetes deployment configs
Monitoring: Health checks and performance metrics
This project will provide hands-on experience with enterprise Java development practices used in defense contracting, including the specific technologies and methodologies mentioned in the Caribou Thunder job posting.
