Project Overview
Create a Java-based Command and Control System Simulator that mimics the functionality of military joint operations platforms like GCCS-J. This project will demonstrate enterprise-level software development practices used in defense contracting environments.

Project Name: tactical-command-hub
Core Objectives
Build a scalable, secure command and control system that can:

Manage tactical unit positioning and status
Process real-time mission data feeds
Coordinate multi-domain operations (land, air, sea, cyber)
Generate operational reports and analytics
Maintain audit trails for all system actions
