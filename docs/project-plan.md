# Tactical Command Hub - Project Plan

## Project Overview

The **Tactical Command Hub** is a comprehensive Java-based Command and Control System Simulator designed to replicate the functionality of military joint operations platforms like GCCS-J (Global Command and Control System - Joint). This enterprise-level application demonstrates defense contracting software development practices, incorporating real-time tactical unit management, mission planning, multi-domain coordination, and comprehensive security features.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Mission
Develop a production-ready tactical command and control system that demonstrates:
- **Enterprise Java Development**: Spring Boot 3.x with comprehensive business logic
- **Military Domain Expertise**: Authentic tactical operations modeling
- **Security-First Design**: Defense-grade security and compliance
- **Real-time Operations**: Live tracking and coordination capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices-ready modular design

### Key Deliverables
1. **Core Platform**: Complete command and control system with web interface
2. **API Layer**: RESTful APIs for all tactical operations
3. **Security Framework**: JWT authentication with role-based access control
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket-based live updates and messaging
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical and user documentation

## Technical Architecture
