# Service Layer Patterns

## Service Architecture
- Business logic separation from controllers and repositories
- Transaction management with @Transactional
- Error handling and validation patterns
- DTO patterns for data transfer

## Military Service Patterns
- Unit management services (create, update, track, coordinate)
- Mission lifecycle services (planning, execution, completion)
- Event tracking and notification services
- Coordination and synchronization services

## Spring Boot Best Practices
- Dependency injection with @Autowired or constructor injection
- Configuration properties with @Value and @ConfigurationProperties
- Logging with SLF4J and structured logging
- Async processing with @Async for non-blocking operations

## Error Handling
- Custom exception classes for business logic errors
- Global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
- Validation with Bean Validation (JSR-303)
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service calls

## Performance Considerations
- Caching strategies with @Cacheable
- Pagination with Spring Data
- Lazy loading and batch processing
- Database connection pooling optimization
